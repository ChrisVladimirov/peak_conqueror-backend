# peak_conqueror-backend

This is the main backend api for the <b>Peak Conqueror App</b>.
It covers the authentication/authorization, users, 
and CRUD (routes & pictures)
services to be consumed by the ReactJS frontend.

In order to generate public and private key you can use a command in bash
similar to `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@com"`.

`mvn spring-boot:run` runs the app upon download. <em>/Maven client required!/</em>
